#Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent
## Introduction
(about 100-150 words)
Discuss the design of the project. What does this project/product do? Who are the users? 
What are the technologies you have used? (e.g. bash, docker, git, etc..)
#### What does this project do?
In this project, we are writing several shell script files that record the 
server's hardware information and monitor the server's resource usage in real-time(once a minute).
After that, the data will be stored in an RDBMS(PpstgreSQL in this project) for future planning purpose.

#### Who are the users?
Originally,the project is designed for the **Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration(LCA)** team which
manages a Linux cluster of 10 servers. The LCA team would like to collect the hardware specification
of each server and monitor the real-time states of the server's resource usage. The LCA team will
use the data to generate reports for future resource planning purposes.

#### Technologies used?

-**Git&Git Repository:**
-**Docker:**
-**JRV:**
-**Bash script&Linux Command:**
-**PostgreSQL:**
