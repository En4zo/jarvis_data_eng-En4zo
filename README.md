# Enzuo Mou . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from Queen's University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I possess a solid foundation in fundamental concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and RDBM. My practical experience includes an internship at a computer equipment company where I developed a user management page and a search and delete function for a bank evaluation machine's evaluation system. Additionally, I have experience building a webapp for stock data analysis, demonstrating my ability to apply my technical skills to real-world projects. I possess strong coding,self-learning, and problem-solving skills, as demonstrated by my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies. I believe that the operation of modern society is closely tied to computer technology, making it essential to have a deep understanding of it. I find great satisfaction in finding and resolving bugs while programming. My education and experiences have prepared me well for a career as a junior software engineer, and I am excited to begin my full-time career in this field.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-En4zo](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-En4zo)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-En4zo/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux monitoring agent that enables users to easily monitor and store machine specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. The agent utilizes Bash scripts to gather hardware information from the machines, which is then securely stored in a PostgreSQL database that is provisioned using Docker. To ensure accurate and up-to-date information, resource usage is fetched at regular intervals using Crontab. The collected data can then be easily analyzed and manipulated using SQL queries, providing users with valuable insights and performance metrics for their Linux systems.

**Manipulate an Existing Database** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-En4zo/tree/master/sql)]: To deepen our understanding of relational databases, relational database management systems, structured query language, optimizations, and data models, we familiarized ourselves with these concepts through hands-on work. Using DBeaver as an IDE, we practiced manipulating existing data and compared our query results with expected outcomes. The existing data was stored in a file, clubdata.sql, which was imported into a PostgreSQL database deployed in a Docker container. This hands-on approach allowed us to gain a practical understanding of the concepts and strengthen our skills in the field.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-En4zo/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - Grep App: Implementing the widely used Linux command grep in Java using Java 8. This project is designed for anyone who wants to quickly search for strings within files. With the grep app, users can filter files and find target strings more efficiently, thereby saving time. The project utilizes Java's Stream API and lambda functions for efficient string searching within files. Maven manages dependencies, including slf4j and log4j for log management. The Java Scanner and BufferedWriter classes are used to read and write data from and to files respectively. The project is built and packaged into a jar file using Maven, and the jar file is further packaged into a Docker image for easy deployment. The Docker image is available on Docker Hub for easy access.


## Highlighted Projects
**Distributed System and Inter-Thread Communication Mechanism(Java)**: Realized inter-thread communication mechanism using Java Sockets and RMI to allow different processes/thread to communicate over TCP/IP network. Compared different page replacement algorithms in a centralized system that uses virtual memory. Used a distributed system and implemented each page replacement algorithm on particular computer server.

**GNU Jami Architectures Analysis**: Analyzed and studied architecture, data flow of GNU Jami, and interaction subsystems of GUN Jami. Provided GNU Jami with features, replacing the central server with blockchain to store user accounts.

**YOLOv3 Object Detection(Python)**: Implemented object detection model with YOLOv3 and VOC2007+2012 dataset. Realized real-time detection of 20 types of objects in video (including people, cars, boats, cats, dogs, etc.) Evaluated using mAP value, obtaining mAP of 84.22%.


## Professional Experiences

**Junior Software Developer, Jarvis (Jan 2022-present)**: Joined Jarvis as a junior software developer to develop, consult, and assist customers with their software solutions. I work in an Agile/Scrum development environment, where I participate in daily scrum meetings with the scrum master to discuss project progress. Our sprint cycle is two weeks, with a sprint meeting held every two weeks. At Jarvis, I have gained exposure to various technologies commonly used in professional technical environments, such as Java, RDMS, Linux, Docker, Spring Boot, etc.

**Software Engineer, Poros Consulting (July2022-Nov2022)**: Assigned to implement a stock data analysis system. Adhering to the Agile methodology, I regularly updated my supervisor on my progress. I developed the web application using Django as the back-end framework and Apache ECharts for data visualization and stock trading history. My full-stack web development skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript were utilized to design a RESTful back-end server for storing stock information persistently in MySQL. Throughout the project, I also created technical documents and prepared presentations to showcase my work to my supervisor. After completion, I presented the implemented components and demonstrated the functionality of the web application.

**Software Engineer, Start Computer Equipment Corporation (July2021-Sep2021)**: Tasked with comprehending the framework of the bank evaluation machine's management system and designing the user management page. The management system was implemented using Java and Spring Boot. I successfully completed the user management page, including adding the ability to query machines based on time, region, and relevant data stored in a MySQL database. Daily progress was reported to my instructor, and I also participated in weekly technology-sharing meetings with the team where the team leader would share interesting new projects and emerging technologies on Github with everyone.
