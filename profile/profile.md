# Enzuo Mou . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from Queen's University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I possess a solid foundation in fundamental concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and RDBM. My practical experience includes an internship at a computer equipment company where I developed a user management page and a search and delete function for a bank evaluation machine's evaluation system. Additionally, I have experience building a webapp for stock data analysis, demonstrating my ability to apply my technical skills to real-world projects. I possess strong coding,self-learning, and problem-solving skills, as demonstrated by my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies. I believe that the operation of modern society is closely tied to computer technology, making it essential to have a deep understanding of it. I find great satisfaction in finding and resolving bugs while programming. My education and experiences have prepared me well for a career as a junior software engineer, and I am excited to begin my full-time career in this field.

## Jarvis Projects

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-En4zo/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux monitoring agent that enables users to easily monitor and store machine specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. The agent utilizes Bash scripts to gather hardware information from the machines, which is then securely stored in a PostgreSQL database that is provisioned using Docker. To ensure accurate and up-to-date information, resource usage is fetched at regular intervals using Crontab. The collected data can then be easily analyzed and manipulated using SQL queries, providing users with valuable insights and performance metrics for their Linux systems.

**Manipulate an Existing Database** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-En4zo/tree/master/sql)]: To deepen our understanding of relational databases, relational database management systems, structured query language, optimizations, and data models, we familiarized ourselves with these concepts through hands-on work. Using DBeaver as an IDE, we practiced manipulating existing data and compared our query results with expected outcomes. The existing data was stored in a file, clubdata.sql, which was imported into a PostgreSQL database deployed in a Docker container. This hands-on approach allowed us to gain a practical understanding of the concepts and strengthen our skills in the field.


## Highlighted Projects
**Distributed System and Inter-Thread Communication Mechanism(Java)**: Realized inter-thread communication mechanism using Java Sockets and RMI to allow different processes/thread to communicate over TCP/IP network. Compared different page replacement algorithms in a centralized system that uses virtual memory. Used a distributed system and implemented each page replacement algorithm on particular computer server.

**GNU Jami Architectures Analysis**: Analyzed and studied architecture, data flow of GNU Jami, and interaction subsystems of GUN Jami. Provided GNU Jami with features, replacing the central server with blockchain to store user accounts.

**YOLOv3 Object Detection(Python)**: Implemented object detection model with YOLOv3 and VOC2007+2012 dataset. Realized real-time detection of 20 types of objects in video (including people, cars, boats, cats, dogs, etc.) Evaluated using mAP value, obtaining mAP of 84.22%.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (Jan 2022-present)**: Implemented cluster monitor that allows user to monitor and store hardware specification and hardware usage information by bash script.Stored the hardware data and hardware usage data into PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. Fetched hardware usage periodically with Crontab.

**Software Engineer, Poros Consulting (July2022-Nov2022)**: Implemented by python(with Django as backend framework) to analyze stock data. Visualized companies information and stock exchange history with Apache ECharts. Leveraged knowledge in full stack web development with HTML, CSS and Javascript.Designed RESTful backend server enabling stock information to be stored persistently in an MySQL.

**Software Engineer, Start Computer Equipment Corporation (July2021-Sep2021)**: Designed user management pages for management system webapp of bank evaluation machine with using Java and Spring framework. Implemented functions that query machine based on time, area, or relevant data from MySQL database.
