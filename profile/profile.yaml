summary: I am a recent graduate from Queen's University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I possess a solid foundation in
  fundamental concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and RDBM. My practical experience includes an internship at a
  computer equipment company where I developed a user management page and a search and delete function for a bank evaluation
  machine's evaluation system. Additionally, I have experience building a webapp for stock data analysis, demonstrating my
  ability to apply my technical skills to real-world projects. I possess strong coding,self-learning, and
  problem-solving skills, as demonstrated by my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies. I believe that the 
  operation of modern society is closely tied to computer technology, making it essential to
  have a deep understanding of it. I find great satisfaction in finding and resolving bugs while programming. My education and
  experiences have prepared me well for a career as a junior software engineer, and I am excited to begin my full-time career
  in this field.

    description: Developed a Linux monitoring agent that enables users to easily monitor and store machine specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. The agent utilizes Bash scripts to gather hardware information from the machines, which is then securely stored in a PostgreSQL database that is provisioned using Docker. To ensure accurate and up-to-date information, resource usage is fetched at regular intervals using Crontab. The collected data can then be easily analyzed and manipulated using SQL queries, providing users with valuable insights and performance metrics for their Linux systems.
  - name : "Manipulate an Existing Database"
    git_url: "/sql"
    description: To deepen our understanding of relational databases, relational database management systems, structured query language, optimizations, and data models, we familiarized ourselves with these concepts through hands-on work. Using DBeaver as an IDE, we practiced manipulating existing data and compared our query results with expected outcomes. The existing data was stored in a file, clubdata.sql, which was imported into a PostgreSQL database deployed in a Docker container. This hands-on approach allowed us to gain a practical understanding of the concepts and strengthen our skills in the field.
