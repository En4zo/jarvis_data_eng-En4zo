      "description": "Developed a Linux monitoring agent that enables users to easily monitor and store machine specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. The agent utilizes Bash scripts to gather hardware information from the machines, which is then securely stored in a PostgreSQL database that is provisioned using Docker. To ensure accurate and up-to-date information, resource usage is fetched at regular intervals using Crontab. The collected data can then be easily analyzed and manipulated using SQL queries, providing users with valuable insights and performance metrics for their Linux systems.",

Using DBeaver as an IDE, we practiced manipulating existing data and compared our query results with expected outcomes. The existing data was stored in a file, clubdata.sql, which was imported into a PostgreSQL database deployed in a Docker container. This hands-on approach allowed us to gain a practical understanding of the concepts and strengthen our skills in the field.",

  "summary": "I am a recent graduate from Queen's University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I possess a solid foundation in fundamental concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and RDBM. My practical experience includes an internship at a computer equipment company where I developed a user management page and a search and delete function for a bank evaluation machine's evaluation system. Additionally, I have experience building a webapp for stock data analysis, demonstrating my ability to apply my technical skills to real-world projects. I possess strong coding,self-learning, and problem-solving skills, as demonstrated by my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies. I believe that the operation of modern society is closely tied to computer technology, making it essential to have a deep understanding of it. I find great satisfaction in finding and resolving bugs while programming. My education and experiences have prepared me well for a career as a junior software engineer, and I am excited to begin my full-time career in this field."
